    "\n",
    "In this task you need to implement a class (i.e. user defined type) `CaesarCipher` that allows you to perform encoding and decoding using the Caesar Cipher described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to the Caesar Cipher:\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher is a cryptographic technique in which each letter in the text is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The number of positions by which the letters are shifted is called the `key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encryption Process\n",
    "Choose a Key: Select a fixed number of positions to shift. For example, if the `key` is `3`, each letter will be shifted three places forward in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift each letter: For each letter in the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find its position in the alphabet (e.g., `A=0`, `B=1`, ..., `Z=25`).\n",
    "- Add the `key` to this position.\n",
    "- Find the letter that corresponds to the new position (modulo `26`, since there are `26` letters in the English alphabet).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's encrypt the text `\"HELLO\"` with a `key` of `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `H` -> `K` (`H` is the `8`th letter, `8+3=11`, `K` is the `11`th letter)\n",
    "- `E` -> `H` (`E` is the `5`th letter, `5+3=8`, `H` is the `8`th letter)\n",
    "- `L` -> `O` (`L` is the `12`th letter, `12+3=15`, `O` is the `15`th letter)\n",
    "- `L` -> `O` (same as above)\n",
    "- `O` -> `R` (`O` is the `15`th letter, `15+3=18`, `R` is the `18`th letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the text `\"HELLO\"` is encoded as `\"KHOOR\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You should respect capitalisation, so that `\"Hello\"` is encoded as `\"Khoor\"`, i.e. the capital letter `H` is mapped to the capital letter `K`, while small letter `e` is mapped to the small letter `h`.\n",
    "- You should leave non-alphabetical letters unchanged, so that `\"Hello !!\"` is encoded as `\"Khoor !!\"`. \n",
    "- You should only modify letters in the **English** alphabet, i.e. `A-Z` and `a-z`. *Unicode* (`utf-8` encoding, for example) and other formats of text encodings allow the use of non-English letters such as `ä`, `ó`, `ü`, `ç` etc. Such letters should not be modified. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decryption Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The decryption process works by reversing the above process - by shifting each letter backward by the `key`, i.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each letter in the encrypted text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find its position in the alphabet.\n",
    "- Subtract the `key`.\n",
    "- Find the letter that corresponds to the new position (modulo `26`).\n",
