    "# General Principles of Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will probably have realised by now, a lot of time allocated for programming is not actually spent on writing code, but rather on finding and eliminating errors or ''bugs'', as they are known in computer science. To spend our time productively, we have to develop good strategies for avoiding and locating these bugs (once we have found a bug, fixing it is often relatively straightforward). Fortunately there exist general guidelines and tools that help us with this. In this notebook we will review some of these and apply them to a particular example.\n",

    "* General principles of debugging\n",
    "* The scientific method\n",

    "## What is a bug?\n",
    "The term ''bug'' for an error in a computer code was coined in 1945, when computer engineers found a moth trapped in the circuits of the Mark II computer. This poor insect had shortcircuited the machine, causing an error in program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![First bug: moth in computer relay of the Mark II computer](./figures/FirstBug.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, if our code does not work nowadays this is usually not due to some mechanical failure but rather due to some mistake in the computer code. In semester 1 we discussed how thoroughly testing code can avoid these mistakes. Unfortunately, it is still virtually impossible to write bug-free code and we need to come up with strategies for identifying errors efficiently and reliably."

    "Obviously, it helps greatly if we can localise the issue with our code and narrow down the problem to a few lines of suspect code. For this, writing modular code is essential. In practice this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* splitting our program into (well documented) functions\n",

    "* not using global variables\n",
    "* using object oriented design (we will talk about this later this semester)\n",
    "\n",

    "However, even when we have limited the problem to a handful of lines, it is still very hard to spot bugs by just looking at some computer code. Since ''the eye sees what the brain wants to see'', it is easy to miss a mistake in code that we think should work. This has two important consequences that might sound obvious but are often ignored:\n",

    "### Digression: the scientific method\n",
    "To illustrate the importance of the second point, let us look at a seemingly unrelated problem: the development of new scientific theories. To consider a particular example, recall that before the Renaissance one of the leading astronomical theories assumed that celestial bodies such as the stars, the planets and their moons were attached to large, concentric crystal spheres that enclose the Earth. These theories predicted the movements of the planets very well, so there were good reasons to assume that the theory was correct. Obviously, we now know that the universe is not made up of crystal spheres, but how would we be able to prove this just by looking at the trajectories of celestial bodies? While observing the moons of Jupiter (which, incidentially, have inspired the logo of project Jupyter...) Galileo Galilei discovered that these moons sometimes disappeared behind the planet. Since the crystal spheres were deemed to be indestructible, this clearly conflicts with the old theory. To address this shortcoming, one could form a new hypothesis: the movement of the planets and their moons is governed by gravitational attraction. Note that Galilei's thinking when ''debugging'' the incorrect theory went like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(old) hypothesis**: celestial bodies are attached to crystal spheres\n",
    "2. **design experiment** to test the hypothesis: if this is true, then the moons of Jupiter can not disappear\n",
    "3. **carry out experiment to gather evidence**: my telescope shows me that the moons do disappear\n",
    "4. **correct old hypothesis** and form **new hypothesis**: the crystal sphere theory must be wrong, planets and moons move according to gravitational attraction\n",
    "\n",
    "It now seems inconceivable to us not to apply this approach, but before Galilei it was completely acceptable to ignore the evidence (and instead rely on the authority of ancient philosophical texts). Galilei's new approach is known as the **Scientific Method** and it can be summarised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*''A method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic **observation**, **measurement**, and **experiment**, and the **formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses**.''*"
