    "# The JupyterLab Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we have tried to gain insights into the behaviour of the code by adding print statements. This often works well, but there is a more elegant method: we can use a dedicated debugger that allows us to step through the code line-by-line while inspecting the values of variables. Although Python comes with a [built-in debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html), this is quite hard to use. for this reason we will look at the JupyterLab debugger, which provides a more intuitive graphical interface. In this notebook we will discuss the JupyterLab debugger interface and look at how it can be used to find a subtle bug in an example code.\n",
