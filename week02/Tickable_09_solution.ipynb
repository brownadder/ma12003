    "## Discussion of the bug\n",
    "The problem with the code is that the arrays `x_int` and `y_int` are created such that their datatype is `np.int8`. Recall from the [lecture on Storing numbers on a computer](../week01/Lecture_12_StoringNumbers.ipynb) that this datatype can only integer store numbers in the range $-128\\dots127$. In the problematic code the second array `y = np.array([220.2,122.4])` contains numbers outside this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this issue, we need to create `x_int` and `y_int` such that their type can store larger numbers. For example, we could use `np.int32`, which holds numbers in the range $-2^{31},\\dots,2^{31}-1\\approx -2\\cdot 10^{9},\\dots,+2\\cdot 10^{9}$. For this, change the two lines\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "x_int = np.array(x,dtype=np.int8)\n",
    "y_int = np.array(y,dtype=np.int8)\n",

    "y_int = np.array(y,dtype=np.int32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we still get incorrect results if the user calls the function with extremely large numbers, so we probably want to check the contents of the two input arrays `x` and `y` if this happens."
