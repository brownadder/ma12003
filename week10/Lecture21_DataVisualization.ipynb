This is because a logarithmic plot plots `ln(f(x))` instead of `f(x)`. Thus, if `f(x)=c d^x`, then the log plot shows `ln(c) + x ln(d)` which is linear.

By default, `plt.imshow()` also follows the standard image array definition where the origin is in the upper left, not in the lower left as in most contour plots. This must be changed when showing gridded data. Finally, `plt.imshow()` will automatically adjust the axis aspect ratio to match the input data.

You can also pass a list (must be in increasing order) to explicitly define the contour levels to be plotted. This can help declutter if the default is too tightly packed. The `plt.clabel` command allows you to add labels to the contours themselves. In `plt.imshow()` we redefined the origin to be in the lower left with `origin='lower'`, used a rainbow color scheme for the color map, and we set the transparency to 0.5 with the `alpha` parameter. Note that we plot the `imshow()` after the `contour()` data. So without adjusting the transparency, we would not be able to see the contour lines."

    "## Saving figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, often we need to save the plots in addition to just viewing them. This can be done with `plt.savefig()` which must be called before `plt.show()`. `plt.savefig()` requires a string with the filename. This can be a path as well but note that the string is taken verbatim, i.e., no file extension will be generated and if the path points to something that already exists, it will be replaced. Furthermore, there is a `format` attribute in which you can specify the format the figure is to be saved as, e.g., `'png'`, `'pdf'`, or `'svg'`. The default format is `'png'` although `plt.savefig()` is reasonably smart in detecting file extensions in the file name string and will set it accordingly if positively identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `plt.savefig('picture')` has no file extension and no format set, so it will default to `'png'`. `plt.savefig('picture.pdf')` on the other hand will realize that the format should be `'pdf'` and save the figure as `'pdf'`. If format is provided, it will override the inferred file extension, that is, `plt.savefig('picture.pdf',format='svg')` will save an `'svg'` file although the file extension will say `'pdf'`. "

    "\n",
    "We could plot this data in three subplots. `plt.subplot()` can take three arguments `plt.subplot(r,c,n)` where `r` is the number of rows, `c` the number of columns, and `n` the plot number. If we are looking to have three plots in a row, we would choose `r=1` and `c=3`. For 9 or fewer plots, the numbers `r`, `c`, `n`, can be combined into a single three-digit number, i.e., `plt.subplot(2,3,2)` is equivalent to `plt.subplot(232)`. This approach also requires us to define the figure with `plt.figure(figsize=[width,height])`."
