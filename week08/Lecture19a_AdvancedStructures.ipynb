    "# Advanced structures\n",
    "\n",
    "While a lot can be achieved using lists, sometimes they can be a bit cumbersome. In this lecture, we will discuss a few advanced data structures such as sets, tuples, and dictionaries. Although their functionality can be reproduced using lists, working with these structures can make your code much more readable and avoid errors due to working with data structures that are not suited for the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will consider advanced functionality of functions. In particular, it may often be useful to provide default values for some arguments of a function. This can help keep you code simple and allow for users to only supply the arguments they need for a given application. Additionally, we will discuss a slightly different version of a function, called a generator, which makes the function act like an iterator, similar to the `range()` function. This allows for function outputs to be used in for-loops, for example, or function values can be computed one at a time when they are needed; thus, giving great flexibility in your programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "* sets\n",
    "* tuples\n",
    "* dictionaries\n",
    "* generators\n",
    "* default values for functions\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, a set can be represented as a list by listing all elements. However, if we do this, then we need to ensure that no duplicates are in the list and the ordered nature of a list may not be what we want either. Thus, using a set in Python can simplify your code and make it a lot more efficient.\n"
