    "# Code Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very versatile programming language which allows for code to be run in real-time and scripts to be changed on the fly. Furthermore, Python has many quality of life aspects such as adaptive memory allocation that make programming easy. However, these aspects come at a cost. This cost is computational speed. In general, a Python program executing some code will be much slower than compiled programming languages such as C. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have your code perform efficiently, you will need to understand which parts of your code are slow and what options you have to speed things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "* comparing different loops\n",
    "* redundant operations\n",
    "* built-in Python code, falling back to fast compiled code, and special libraries\n",
    "* keeping data in memory vs on-the-fly computation\n",
    "* comprehensions and the fuctions `lambda`, `map`, and `filter`\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that there are two idependent notions of code efficiency discussed here. On one hand, we will be looking at how fast code will be executed and thus more efficient code will perform a computation faster. On the other hand, we will also discuss code efficiency in terms of compactness of code, that is, more efficient code is written with fewer lines. Although the two concepts are different, they are related. More compact code tends to execute faster and faster code tends to be more compact. Thus, although we will move away from looking at execution speed in the second half of this notebook and focus more on compact code, using these techniques will likely improve your code performance. For this very reason, using these compact coding techniques are industry standard. \n",

    "Although these two functions do essentially the same, we can see that the while loop took almost twice as long as the for loop. Why is that? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is written in the programming language C, which is a compiled language and much faster Python itself. If we look at the difference in our two functions, the while loop increments the index variable i and checks whether i<N using Python, whereas the for loop passes both of these steps on to the `range(N)` object which is written in C. Effectively, the while loop does three slow operations in each loop (`i<N`, `s+=i`, `i+=1`) whereas the for loop uses one slow (`s+=i`) and two fast operations (`i<n` and `i+=1`). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can confirm this, by artificially adding the increment and the check `i<N` into the for loop. To this end, we introduce the `pass` statement. This statement literally tells Python to do nothing. In real code development it is used as a placeholder that allows you to execute code although parts have not yet been written. Here we use it as a line `if j<N: pass` which forces the if-statement to execute but then do nothing at all. So, the code below formally does the same if-check that the while loop does and increments the a counter variable just like the while loop does, but nothing else is executed. Hence, we can see the impact of the two additional Python statements that are present in the while loop and compare it to the performance of a pure for loop. "

    "Numpy is primarily written in C, so why is it so much faster than the Python built-in version? There are two important aspects to why this one is so much faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python uses arbitrary precision numbers. If a number becomes too large for the currently allocated memory, Python will give it more space. This means that Python is checking whether or not the numbers still fit into memory. This operation takes time. Numpy, on the other hand, has fixed memory allocations. It therefore does not need to check whether there is sufficient space and thus saves time. However, if you do run out of memory for your numbers, you will get overflow errors and other problems you will have to deal with. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Python range object is a so-called generator object. It generates one number at a time and only once the for loop inside the sum function requires the next number, the next number will be computed. The numpy.arange object computes all elements in the range at the beginning. It is therefore effectively a list with all the numbers already available at the time the `numpy.sum` function starts looping. This means that `numpy.sum(numpy.arange(N))` is one big C call, whereas `sum(range(N))` still contains Python overhead in the generator `range(N)`. Conversely, because `numpy.arange(N)` creates the entire array in memory, we have just created 100 million numbers in memory. If N were larger, we could run out of memory, i.e., crash the computer. The Python version `sum(range(N))` will run no matter how large N is, provided that N^2 fits into memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, memory constraints are not as critical as speed. As such, it is worth giving up the memory and ensuring yourself that enough memory is available, to let the sum happen in C and get your results faster. In any case, this leads us to our next observation.\n",

    "#### Use purpose-built libraries like Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Sympy, ... for their intended applications over pure Python.\n",

    "While Numpy provides basic arrays and their functionality, SciPy expands on Numpy with many useful tools for scientific and engineering applications. These include image manipulation, data fitting, generation of numerical integration data, and even interoperability with MATLAB files. Similarly, if you are working with large data sets such as in machine learning, then Pandas is a very suitable starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sidenote, the Numpy implementation of this sum reveals a neat order of magintude estimation of hardware specifications. `numpy_sum` does 10^6 additions in its execution. Adding two numbers is a basic operation for the CPU and executes in a single CPU cycle. So, if 10^6 operations require about 10^(-3) seconds, that means that each addition takes about 10^(-9) seconds. From this, we can compute how often my CPU cycles every second; namely 10^9 cycles per second. Note that 1 cycle per second is 1Hz, 1000 cycles/second is 1kHz, 10^6 cycles/second is 1MHz, and 10^9 cycles/second is 1GHz. So my laptop has a CPU that has a clock frequency a few GHz. In fact, most CPUs today run a clock between 2GHz and 5GHz, so this is a fairly decent order of magnitude estimate of how fast my computer can compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### But can we do even better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may wonder whether there is anything we can do to beat Numpy. Frankly, you will be hard pressed to find a better implementation of `numpy.sum(numpy.arange(N))` even in C directly. Numpy does a very good job at implementing basic mathematics. If we were to implement `numpy.sum(numpy.arange(N))` directly in machine code, you could get about a factor 10 on the performance, but there are very few applications in which this effort is justifiable. Alternatively, you could try to split the sum into parts and process them in parallel before eventually summing up the individual results. In that case you would get an improvement factor of roughly the number of CPUs you have available. Thus, realistically, `numpy.sum(numpy.arange(N))` is about as optimized as it is ever going to get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the only feasible way of making things faster is to be smart about it. After all, there is a point to mathematics and in this case, we know that the sum of numbers from 0 to N-1 is given by `N*(N-1)/2`. So, what if we implement this formula?"

    "The other main application for lambda functions is the `map` function. `map(function,iterable)` produces a generator object that applies the function to each element of the iterable. Again, to be able to read the output, we will cast it into a list. "
