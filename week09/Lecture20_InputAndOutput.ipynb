    "So far, we have mainly been using the `print()` function to output text to the screen. However, in many applications it will be necessary to read data from input files and to write data to output files. In particular, plain text files can be used to store unformatted data in a operating system and platform independent manner. As such, many spreadsheets are stored in .csv (comma separated values) files. Furthermore, it is often useful to have more complicated data or even Python objects stored for common use between different programmes. This can be achieved using the JSON and Pickle formats.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a final important aspect of formatting (which we will need to create a .csv file), and that is linebreaks. End of Line, End of File, and similar markers are objects in files that are commonly not printed but important for the correct displaying and processing of files. The two markers you will encounter most frequently are `\\r` and `\\n`. They denote \"return carriage\" `\\r` and \"new line\" `\\n`. Think about the operation of a type writer: hit enter to move a line down `\\n` and push the paper back to the beginning of the page `\\r`. Since computers don't have carriages, `\\r` is mainly redundant. However, `\\n` is a very common new line symbol. You can see how important these symbols are by looking at ASCII. `\\n` is symbol number 10 in ASCII and `\\r` is symbol number 13. Unfortunately, because `\\r` is a leftover from type writers, its use is operating system dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Unix and all Unix-like systems (including Mac OS X) only use `\\n` for end-of-line. `\\r` means nothing special. As a consequence many programming languages copy this convention and will adjust to/from operating system specific end-of-line sequences when needed. \n",
    "- older Mac systems (pre OS X) use `\\r` as end-of-line and `\\n` means nothing special\n",
    "- Windows and many old operating systems use `\\r\\n` in this order. This is because electromechanical teletype-like terminals use `\\r` to command the carriage back to the leftmost stop (a slow operation) and `\\n` to roll the roller up one line (a fast operation). By using `\\r\\n` the roller can move up while the carriage is still moving left. \n",
    "- Character-mode terminals (typically emulating printing terminals) `\\r` and `\\n` act as \"move cursor all the way left\" and \"move cursor down\" respectively, i.e., both are necessary even though there is no carriage or roller. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means you should use `\\n` to force a new line and expect the underlying runtime to handle any weird operating systems (Windows). However, when it comes to reading from files, you will encounter `\\r` depending on the operating system. \n",
