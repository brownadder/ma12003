    "## Task 1. Transposition Cipher $~~~~$ [10 marks = 50%]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task you need to implement a class (i.e. user defined type) `TranspositionCipher` that allows you to perform encoding and decoding using the Transposition Cipher described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to the Transposition Cipher:\n",
    "The Transposition Cipher is a cryptographic technique that involves rearranging the order of characters or groups of characters in a message to create a secret code. In this coursework we will use Columnar Transposition. The process is described below and illustrated with an example of encoding the message `'Carpe diem, seize the day!'` and decoding it back to its original form using the word `'cipher'` as the key. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a key: Choose a key that will determine the arrangement of the characters in the message. For this assignment, you should assume that none of the characters in the key are repeated. \n",
    "\n",
    "> For our example, the key is `'cipher'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write the message in a tabular form: Create a table of width `n` where `n` is the length of the key (here this is `6`), and write the message in this table one row at a time. The final row might not be full - fill the remaining entries of this row with a `null` character, which should be chosen to be an infrequently occurring character. For this example we use the null character as `'Z'`. Write the key above the message, aligning the characters. Each character in the key corresponds to a column. \n",
    "\n",
    ">| c | i | p | h | e | r |\n",
    ">|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    ">| C | a | r | p | e |   |\n",
    ">| d | i | e | m | , |   |\n",
    ">| s | e | i | z | e |   |\n",
    ">| t | h | e |   | d | a |\n",
    ">| y | ! | Z | Z | Z | Z |\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sort columns: Sort the columns based on the alphabetical order of the characters in the key. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In our example the key is `'cipher'`, so we arrange the columns in the order of `c-e-h-i-p-r`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">| c | e | h | i | p | r |\n",
    ">|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    ">| C | e | p | a | r |   |\n",
    ">| d | , | m | i | e |   |\n",
    ">| s | e | z | e | i |   |\n",
    ">| t | d |   | h | e | a |\n",
    ">| y | Z | Z | ! | Z | Z |\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Read the encoded message: Read the characters column by column. This forms the encoded message.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In our example this is `'Cdstye,edZpmz Zaieh!reieZ   aZ'`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Decoding: To decode the message, follow the steps in reverse. That is, write the encoded text in tabular form column-by-column and write the alphabetically sorted version of the key as a header. Then, re-arrange the columns to the original order of the characters in the key (i.e. header should now be the original key). Then read the table row-by-row to find the decoded message. Lastly, all trailing occurrences (i.e. occurring at the end of the decoded message) of the null character (here `'Z'`) should be removed after decoding to recover the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that Transposition Ciphers do not change the characters themselves but rather rearrange their order. This makes it different from substitution ciphers where characters are replaced with other characters or symbols.\n",

    "* In the skeletal code, the `__init__()` method uses the key `'cipher'` and the alphabetical order of its characters `[0,3,4,2,1,5]`. You should fix this so that `self.key` and `self.order` attributes are determined from the attribute `self.rawkey`. To determine the key, use a lower case version of `self.rawkey`, remove all non-alphabetical characters, and only the first occurrence of a character should be kept. For example, `self.rawkey='Unknown'` should result in `self.key='unkow'` and `self.order=[3, 1, 0, 2, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement the method `__str__()` to return a string representation of a `TranspositionCipher` object in the format `rawkey { key : order : null }` (please pay attention to the blank spaces), for example `str(TC)` for our first example above should return `'Unknown { unkow : [3, 1, 0, 2, 4] : Z }'`\n",

    "You can assume that whenever the parameter `rawkey` is specified, it will have atleast 2 unique characters. For example, we will never use strings such as `'a'`, `'cc'`, `'nnn'` etc as values of the `rawkey` parameter, but could use `'if'`, `'hi'`, `'bob'`, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You can use `s.join(stringlist)` to join a list of strings, with `s` as the joining string. e.g. `'<->'.join(['hi','how','are','you?'])` gives the string `'hi<->how<->are<->you?'`."
