This is an example to demonstrate Task 2.

BOB.
Hi Alice, do you still have the coin that I gave you?

Alice notices that Eve has just entered the room

ALICE.
No, I gave it to Eve. 
Eve, do you have the coin I gave you?

EVE. 
Possibly.
But if I did, I would not return it to you.

An uncomfortable silence ensues.
