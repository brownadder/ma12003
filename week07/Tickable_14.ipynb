    "Duck typing allows a very interesting use of the `Complex` class: The implementation of the methods in the `Complex` class requires the operations `-,+,*,**,/` to be performed on the attributes `re` and `im`. Till now we have created `Complex` numbers where the real and imaginary components are `int` or `float`. However, the operations `-,+,*,**,/` can be performed on instances of **any** class that implements `Field` (i.e. derives from `Field` and implement all the abstract methods). In particular, these operations can also be performed on instances of `Rational`. This allow us to create complex numbers where the real and imaginary components `re` and `im` are `Rational` (without any extra effort)!\n",
