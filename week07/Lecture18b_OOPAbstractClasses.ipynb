    "In Lecture 18a, we have seen how to use inheritance in the context of *concrete* classes - i.e. classes whose instances can be created (such as `HomoSapien`, `LivingBeing` etc.). There is another context in which inheritance proves valuable: *abstract* classes. An abstract class is a class whose instances cannot be created. Typically, these classes leave the functionality of some methods unspecified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only use of these classes is in the context of inheritance - we create a *derived* class that inherits from such an abstract class. If the derived class defines the functionality of all methods in the abstract class, we can create its instance. If functionality of some methods remains unspecified, the derived class is also abstract and we cannot create its instances. \n",
