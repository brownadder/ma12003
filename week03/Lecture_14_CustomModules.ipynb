    "# Writing custom modules\n",
    "In the last semester we have seen how we can use functions to implement algorithms that we want to execute repeatedly. However, a function will only do exactly one thing. What if we want to collect several functions that do related things? For example, we might want to write a set of functions for working with rational numbers and collect these in a function library that be used in several applications. In this notebook we will look at how related functions can be collected in a Python module which can then easily be reused later.\n",
