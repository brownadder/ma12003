    "## Representing polynomials with lists\n",

    "Constant polynomials are stored as lists with a single entry, e.g. $p(x)=2.5$ is stored as `[2.5,]` (the second comma is important). Note that this representation is unique if we make sure that the highest order coefficient of polynomials of positive degree is always be non-zero. For example, the polynomial in eq. ($\\star$) should not be stored as `[0.0, -1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 0.0]` or `[0.0, -1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0]`. i.e. there shouldn't be trailing zeros.\n",
